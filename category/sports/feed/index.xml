<p>Will Karim Benzema stay at Real Madrid , or will he move to Saudi Arabian football &#8211; this discussion has entered the European football world anew. Rumors of Lionel Messi going to play football in Saudi Arabia are getting old. But before it was settled, there were rumors about Benzema again.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad have offered 400 million euros for Benzema, starting the rumours. Soon after, the news came, Benzema told Real Madrid &#8211; he will go to play football in Saudi Arabia. When Benzema was asked about the matter, he kept the mystery and said, &#8216;I am still in Madrid. For now, I am thinking about the match against Bilbao.&#8217;</p>



<p>Real will play their last match of the season against Athletic Bilbao tomorrow. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was asked by reporters about Benzema at the press conference today before that match. There he said, he believes that Benzema will stay in Real, not go to football in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>&#8220;Benzema is ready to play tomorrow,&#8221; Ancelotti said at the press conference. He is recovering very well. His current contract has one more year to run. So we have no doubt about his being here.&#8217;</p>



<p>Not only until next year, Real&#8217;s Italian coach Ancelotti believes that Benzema will stay at the Bernabeu for many more days. He thinks this should be the case with club legends. But Ancelotti reminded everyone of the fact that everything depends on the situation.</p>



<p>At the press conference, the Italian coach said, &#8216;Club legends should retire at Real Madrid. I think that&#8217;s what the club and all the supporters think. But certain players also have things to think about.&#8217;</p>

<p>Two consecutive IPL finals. Had Ravindra Jadeja not done something superhuman in the last two balls, Gujarat would have won two consecutive IPL titles, becoming the first team after Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings . Captain Hardik Pandya would have also entered a small list.</p>



<p>After Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir, Pandya also won at least two titles as a captain. In the end it didn&#8217;t happen anymore. He lost to Dhoni, whom he admires. Pandya doesn&#8217;t regret losing the final, as the Gujarat captain doesn&#8217;t mind losing to Dhoni.</p>



<p>Gujarat released a video paying tribute to Dhoni before facing Chennai in the first qualifier of the IPL. In that video, Gujarat captain Pandya said about &#8216;Captain Cool&#8217; Dhoni, &#8216;I am a fan of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. You have to be a devil to hate Mahi (Dhoni) .&#8217;</p>



<p>What Pandya said even after the match yesterday, it is clear how much his devotion is towards Dhoni. About Dhoni, the Gujarat captain said, &#8216;I am very happy for Dhoni. It was written in his fate. If I have to lose, I don&#8217;t mind losing to Dhoni. Good things happen to good people.&#8217;</p>



<p>Gujarat skipper Pandya is not making excuses for the loss, saying Chennai played better cricket than Gujarat, saying, &#8216;We win together, we lose together. I am not one to make excuses. Chennai played better cricket than us. The name of Sai Sudarshan must be mentioned. He will do something incredible in the future. I am very happy with the cricketers.&#8217;</p>



<p>Jadeja, who won the final with 10 runs off the last 2 balls, dedicated Chennai&#8217;s title to Dhoni, &#8216;As a team, we want to dedicate this title to Dhoni, a special member of our team.&#8217;</p>
